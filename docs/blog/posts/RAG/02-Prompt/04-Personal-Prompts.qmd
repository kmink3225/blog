## Chain of Density 요약

    """Article: {ARTICLE}
You will generate increasingly concise, entity-dense summaries of the above article. 

Repeat the following 2 steps 5 times. 

Step 1. Identify 1-3 informative entities (";" delimited) from the article which are missing from the previously generated summary. 
Step 2. Write a new, denser summary of identical length which covers every entity and detail from the previous summary plus the missing entities. 

A missing entity is:
- relevant to the main story, 
- specific yet concise (100 words or fewer), 
- novel (not in the previous summary), 
- faithful (present in the article), 
- anywhere (can be located anywhere in the article).

Guidelines:

- The first summary should be long (8-10 sentences, ~200 words) yet highly non-specific, containing little information beyond the entities marked as missing. Use overly verbose language and fillers (e.g., "this article discusses") to reach ~200 words.
- Make every word count: rewrite the previous summary to improve flow and make space for additional entities.
- Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like "the article discusses".
- The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained, i.e., easily understood without the article. 
- Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary.
- Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be made, add fewer new entities. 

Remember, use the exact same number of words for each summary.
Answer in JSON. The JSON should be a list (length 5) of dictionaries whose keys are "Missing_Entities" and "Denser_Summary".
Use only KOREAN language to reply."""

    """
As an LLM evaluator (judge), please assess the LLM's response to the given question. Evaluate the response's accuracy, comprehensiveness, and context precision based on the provided context. After your evaluation, return only the numerical scores in the following format:
Accuracy: [score]
Comprehensiveness: [score]
Context Precision: [score]
Final: [normalized score]
Grading rubric:

Accuracy (0-10 points):
Evaluate how well the answer aligns with the information provided in the given context.

0 points: The answer is completely inaccurate or contradicts the provided context
4 points: The answer partially aligns with the context but contains significant inaccuracies
7 points: The answer mostly aligns with the context but has minor inaccuracies or omissions
10 points: The answer fully aligns with the provided context and is completely accurate


Comprehensiveness (0-10 points):

0 points: The answer is completely inadequate or irrelevant
3 points: The answer is accurate but too brief to fully address the question
7 points: The answer covers main aspects but lacks detail or misses minor points
10 points: The answer comprehensively covers all aspects of the question


Context Precision (0-10 points):
Evaluate how precisely the answer uses the information from the provided context.

0 points: The answer doesn't use any information from the context or uses it entirely incorrectly
4 points: The answer uses some information from the context but with significant misinterpretations
7 points: The answer uses most of the relevant context information correctly but with minor misinterpretations
10 points: The answer precisely and correctly uses all relevant information from the context


Final Normalized Score:
Calculate by summing the scores for accuracy, comprehensiveness, and context precision, then dividing by 30 to get a score between 0 and 1.
Formula: (Accuracy + Comprehensiveness + Context Precision) / 30

#Given question:
{question}

#LLM's response:
{answer}

#Provided context:
{context}

Please evaluate the LLM's response according to the criteria above. 

In your output, include only the numerical scores for FINAL NORMALIZED SCORE without any additional explanation or reasoning.
ex) 0.81

Similarly, if the measurement process is highly reliable or consistent, then two measurements taken far apart in time may still be highly correlated. Reliability refers to the degree to which a measurement process produces consistent and accurate results over time.\n\n### Modeling Covariance Structure\n\nThere are 2 types of covariance structure: unbalanced design and balanced design. For now, let's focus on the balanced design.\n\n#### Unbalanced Design\n\n* observations for each subject are not made on the same grid\n* these observations can be made at different time points and different numbers of observations may be made for each subject.\n* Missing observations falls into this category.\n\n#### Balanced Design\n\n* observations for each subject are made on the same grid and there is no missing data.\n  * number and timing of the repeated measurements are the same for all individuals. \n* Then, $t_{ij}$ can be denoted as $t_j$ where $j \\in 1, \\dots, n$ because the size of the measurements is the same ($n_i$ is the same) \n* The covariance of the response variable $\\mathbf Y_{m\\times n}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n  \\text{Cov}(\\mathbf Y) \n

assume the covariance matrices for different subjects are the same, we can denote $\\text{Cov}(\\mathbf Y)=\\Sigma$.\n\n### Covariance Structure Pattern Models\n\n#### Compound symmetry Structure\n\n$$\n  \\text{Cov}(\\mathbf y_i)=\n  \\sigma^2  \n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & \\rho & \\rho & \\dots & \\rho \\\\\n    \\rho & 1 & \\rho & \\dots & \\rho \\\\\n    \\rho & \\rho & 1 & \\dots & \\rho \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots  & \\vdots  & \\ddots & \\vdots  \\\\\n    \\rho & \\rho & \\rho & \\dots & 1 \n  \\end{bmatrix} \n$$\n\n* compound symmetry is a.k.a **Exchangeable**\n* Assume variance is constant across visits (say $\\sigma^2$)\n* Assume correlation between any two visits are constant (say $\\rho$).\n* Parsimonious: there are two parameters in the covariance, $\\sigma^2$ and $\\rho$ (computational benefit)\n* Without any contraint on $\\sigma^2$, you will get closed form estimate.\n* Covariance variance matrix is plugged into likelihood function to estimate 3 kinds of parameters $\\sigma^2$, $\\rho$, and $\\beta$\n* This structure is so parsimonuous that it could be unrealistic: not commonly used\n\n#### Toeplitz Structure\n\n$$\n  \\text{Cov}(\\mathbf y_i)=\n  \\sigma^2  \n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & \\rho_1 & \\rho_2 & \\dots & \\rho_{n-1} \\\\\n    \\rho_1 & 1 & \\rho_1 & \\dots & \\rho_{n-2} \\\\\n    \\rho_2 & \\rho_1 & 1 & \\dots & \\rho_{n-3} \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots  & \\vdots  & \\ddots & \\vdots  \\\\\n    \\rho_{n-1} & \\rho_{n-2} & \\rho_{n-3} & \\dots & 1 \n  \\end{bmatrix} \n$$\n\n* Toeplitz structure is more flexible than compound symmetry\n* Assume variance is constant across visits and $\\text{Corr}(y_{ij}, y_{i,j+k}) = \\rho_k$.\n* Assume correlation among responses at adjacent measurements is constant.\n* Only suitable for measurements made at equal intervals of time between different measurement.\n* Without any contraint on $\\sigma^2$, you will get closed form estimate.\n* Toeplitz covariance has free $n$ parameters to estimate ($1$ for variance and $n-1$ correlation parameters)\n* The larger time differences, the smaller its correlations\n\n#### Autoregressive Structure\n\n$$\n  \\text{Cov}(\\mathbf y_i)=\n  \\sigma^2  \n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & \\rho^1 & \\rho^2 & \\dots & \\rho^{n-1} \\\\\n    \\rho^1 & 1 & \\rho^1 & \\dots & \\rho^{n-2} \\\\\n    \\rho^2 & \\rho^1 & 1 & \\dots & \\rho^{n-3} \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots  & \\vdots  & \\ddots & \\vdots  \\\\\n    \\rho^{n-1} & \\rho^{n-2} & \\rho^{n-3} & \\dots & 1 \n  \\end{bmatrix} \n$$\n\n* A special case of toeplitz structure with $\\text{Corr}(y_{ij},y_{i,j+k})=\\rho^k$\n* simpler than toeplitz, only 2 parameters\n* Only suitable for measurements made at equal intervals of time between different measurement.\n\n#### Banded Structure\n\n$$\n  \\text{Cov}(\\mathbf y_i)=\n  \\sigma^2  \n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & \\rho^1 & 0 & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n    \\rho^1 & 1 & \\rho^1 & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n    0 & \\rho^1 & 1 & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots  & \\vdots  & \\ddots & \\vdots  \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 0 & \\dots & 1 \n  \\end{bmatrix} \n$$\n\nLook at the more general case of the banded structure in [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_matrix).\n\n* Assume correlation is 0 beyond some specified interval.\n* Can be combined with the previous patterns.\n* Very strong assumption about how quickly the correlation decays to 0 with increasing time separation.\n\n#### Exponential Structure\n\n* A generalization of autoregressive pattern\n* The most general and reasonable structure\n* Suitable for unevenly spaced measurements, take actual time points (time difference), the larger time difference the smaller correlation\n* Assumption that the variance of different measurements over time is the same, which can be easily generalized. You can put different variance on the diagonal.\n* Let $\\{t_{i1},\\dots,t_{in_i}\\}$ denote the observation times for the $i$ th individual. Then, the correlation is $\\text{Corr}(Y_{ij} ,Y_{ik}) = \\rho^{|t_{ij}-t_{ik}|}$\n* Correlation decreases exponentially with the time separations between them.\n\n\n:::\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"tab-pane fade\" id=\"English\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"English-tab\">\n\n::: {#English .tab-pane .fade role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"English-tab\"}\n\n:::\n\n</div>\n\n## Go to Blog Content List\n\n[Blog Content List](../../content_list.qmd)","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n<ul class=\"nav nav-pills\" id=\"language-tab\" role=\"tablist\">\n  <li class=\"nav-item\" role=\"presentation\">\n    <button class=\"nav-link active\" id=\"Korean-tab\" data-bs-toggle=\"tab\" data-bs-target=\"#Korean\" type=\"button\" role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"Korean\" aria-selected=\"true\">Korean</button>\n  </li>\n  <li class=\"nav-item\" role=\"presentation\">\n    <button class=\"nav-link\" id=\"English-tab\" data-bs-toggle=\"tab\" data-bs-target=\"#English\" type=\"button\" role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"knitr\" aria-selected=\"false\">English</button>\n  </li>\n\n<div class=\"tab-content\" id=\"language-tabcontent\">\n\n<div class=\"tab-pane fade  show active\" id=\"Korean\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"Korean-tab\">\n\n::: {#Korean .tab-pane .fade .show .active role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"Korean-tab\"}\n\n## Notations\n\n* $y_{ij}$ : the univariate response (i.e. scalar) for the $i$ th subject at the $j$ th occasion or measurement\n  * later when I use the vector case, I will re-define this notation, but focus on the scalar case for now.\n* $x_{ij}$ : the predictor at time $t_{ij}$, which is either a scalr or vector.\n  * a scalar case: $x_{ij}$ where $i$ is the $i$ th subject, and $j$ is the $j$ th measurement.\n  * a vector case: $x_{ijk}$ where $i$ is the $i$ th subject, $j$ is the $j$ th measurement, and $k \\in [1,p]$ is the $k$ th predictor.\n  * sometimes, covariate for different measurements could be the same.

assume the covariance matrices for different subjects are the same, we can denote $\\text{Cov}(\\mathbf Y)=\\Sigma$.\n\n### Covariance Structure Pattern Models\n\n#### Compound symmetry Structure\n\n$$\n  \\text{Cov}(\\mathbf y_i)=\n  \\sigma^2  \n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & \\rho & \\rho & \\dots & \\rho \\\\\n    \\rho & 1 & \\rho & \\dots & \\rho \\\\\n    \\rho & \\rho & 1 & \\dots & \\rho \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots  & \\vdots  & \\ddots & \\vdots  \\\\\n    \\rho & \\rho & \\rho & \\dots & 1 \n  \\end{bmatrix} \n$$\n\n* compound symmetry is a.k.a **Exchangeable**\n* Assume variance is constant across visits (say $\\sigma^2$)\n* Assume correlation between any two visits are constant (say $\\rho$).\n* Parsimonious: there are two parameters in the covariance, $\\sigma^2$ and $\\rho$ (computational benefit)\n* Without any contraint on $\\sigma^2$, you will get closed form estimate.\n* Covariance variance matrix is plugged into likelihood function to estimate 3 kinds of parameters $\\sigma^2$, $\\rho$, and $\\beta$\n* This structure is so parsimonuous that it could be unrealistic: not commonly used\n\n#### Toeplitz Structure\n\n$$\n  \\text{Cov}(\\mathbf y_i)=\n  \\sigma^2  \n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & \\rho_1 & \\rho_2 & \\dots & \\rho_{n-1} \\\\\n    \\rho_1 & 1 & \\rho_1 & \\dots & \\rho_{n-2} \\\\\n    \\rho_2 & \\rho_1 & 1 & \\dots & \\rho_{n-3} \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots  & \\vdots  & \\ddots & \\vdots  \\\\\n    \\rho_{n-1} & \\rho_{n-2} & \\rho_{n-3} & \\dots & 1 \n  \\end{bmatrix} \n$$\n\n* Toeplitz structure is more flexible than compound symmetry\n* Assume variance is constant across visits and $\\text{Corr}(y_{ij}, y_{i,j+k}) = \\rho_k$.\n* Assume correlation among responses at adjacent measurements is constant.\n* Only suitable for measurements made at equal intervals of time between different measurement.\n* Without any contraint on $\\sigma^2$, you will get closed form estimate.\n* Toeplitz covariance has free $n$ parameters to estimate ($1$ for variance and $n-1$ correlation parameters)\n* The larger time differences, the smaller its correlations\n\n#### Autoregressive Structure\n\n$$\n  \\text{Cov}(\\mathbf y_i)=\n  \\sigma^2  \n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & \\rho^1 & \\rho^2 & \\dots & \\rho^{n-1} \\\\\n    \\rho^1 & 1 & \\rho^1 & \\dots & \\rho^{n-2} \\\\\n    \\rho^2 & \\rho^1 & 1 & \\dots & \\rho^{n-3} \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots  & \\vdots  & \\ddots & \\vdots  \\\\\n    \\rho^{n-1} & \\rho^{n-2} & \\rho^{n-3} & \\dots & 1 \n  \\end{bmatrix} \n$$\n\n* A special case of toeplitz structure with $\\text{Corr}(y_{ij},y_{i,j+k})=\\rho^k$\n* simpler than toeplitz, only 2 parameters\n* Only suitable for measurements made at equal intervals of time between different measurement.\n\n#### Banded Structure\n\n$$\n  \\text{Cov}(\\mathbf y_i)=\n  \\sigma^2  \n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & \\rho^1 & 0 & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n    \\rho^1 & 1 & \\rho^1 & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n    0 & \\rho^1 & 1 & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots  & \\vdots  & \\ddots & \\vdots  \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 0 & \\dots & 1 \n  \\end{bmatrix} \n$$\n\nLook at the more general case of the banded structure in [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_matrix).\n\n* Assume correlation is 0 beyond some specified interval.\n* Can be combined with the previous patterns.\n* Very strong assumption about how quickly the correlation decays to 0 with increasing time separation.\n\n#### Exponential Structure\n\n* A generalization of autoregressive pattern\n* The most general and reasonable structure\n* Suitable for unevenly spaced measurements, take actual time points (time difference), the larger time difference the smaller correlation\n* Assumption that the variance of different measurements over time is the same, which can be easily generalized. You can put different variance on the diagonal.\n* Let $\\{t_{i1},\\dots,t_{in_i}\\}$ denote the observation times for the $i$ th individual. Then, the correlation is $\\text{Corr}(Y_{ij} ,Y_{ik}) = \\rho^{|t_{ij}-t_{ik}|}$\n* Correlation decreases exponentially with the time separations between them.\n\n\n:::\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"tab-pane fade\" id=\"English\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"English-tab\">\n\n::: {#English .tab-pane .fade role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"English-tab\"}\n\n:::\n\n</div>\n\n## Go to Blog Content List\n\n[Blog Content List](../../content_list.qmd)"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":true,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":true,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","highlight-style":"github","css":["../../../../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"number-sections":true,"include-in-header":[{"text":"<style>\n.custom-footer { \n  text-align: center;

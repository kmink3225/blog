A p-value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result.\n6.  By itself, a p-value does not provide a good measure of evidence regarding a model or hypothesis.\n\n## How to use p-vlaues?\n\nPersonally, I make use of p-values as a tool in data science to just check whether a model result or a set of variables that appears interesting and useful is in the range of normal variability by chance in the exploratory data analysis(EDA) or data mining step.\n\nIf you want to get a statistical significance level through p-values, other methodologies could help increase the accuracy of real significance such as permuted p-values, q-values, and penalization on multiple comparison tests\n\n</div>\n\n## Blog Guide Map Link\n\n* [Statistics Blog](../guide_map/index.qmd)\n* [Engineering Blog](../../Engineering/guide_map/index.qmd)\n* [Deep Learning Blog](../../DL/guide_map/index.qmd)\n* [Machine Learning Blog](../../ML/guide_map/index.qmd)\n* [Mathematics Blog](../../Mathmatics/guide_map/index.qmd)\n* [Patent Blog](../../Patent/guide_map/index.qmd)\n* [Validation Blog](../../Validation/guide_map/index.qmd)\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":true,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","highlight-style":"github","css":["../../../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"number-sections":true,"include-in-header":[{"text":"<style>\n.custom-footer { \n  text-align: center;

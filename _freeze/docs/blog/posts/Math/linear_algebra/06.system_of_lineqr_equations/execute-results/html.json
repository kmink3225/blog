It can be written in the form:\n\n$$\na_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \\ldots + a_nx_n = b\n$$\n\nwhere $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$ are the variables, $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ are the coefficients, and $b$ is a constant term.\n\n### System of Linear Equations\n\nA system of linear equations is a collection of linear equations involving the same variables. It can be written in the form:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\na_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \\ldots + a_{1n}x_n &= b_1 \\\\\na_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \\ldots + a_{2n}x_n &= b_2 \\\\\n&\\vdots \\\\\na_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + \\ldots + a_{mn}x_n &= b_m \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$ are the variables, $a_{ij}$ are the coefficients, and $b_i$ are the constant terms.\n\n* when $n>m$, no solution or infinetely many solutions\n* when $n=m$, no solution or a unique solution\n* when $n<m$, no solution or a unique solution \n  * ex. no solution: $x=2$, $x=3$\n  * ex. unique solution: $x=2$, $2x=4$\n\n### 3 Equations in 3 Unknown Variables\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nx + 2y - z &= 1 \\\\\n2x - y + 3z &= -2 \\\\\nx + 3y + z &= 3 \\\\\n\\end{align*} \n$$\n\ncan be written in matrix form as:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n2 & -1 & 3 \\\\\n1 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny \\\\\nz \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n-2 \\\\\n3 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \n\\end{align*} \n$$\n\nThe matrix form can be represented as :\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nx\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} +\ny\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 \\\\\n-1 \\\\\n3 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} +\nz\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 \\\\\n3 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n-2 \\\\\n3 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \n\\end{align*} \n$$\n\n::: {#97fbea47 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Coefficient matrix of the system of equations\nA = np.array([[3, 2, -1],\n              [2, -1, 3],\n              [1, 3, 1]])\n\n# Right-hand side vector of the system of equations\nb = np.array([1, -2, 3])\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nx = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\n\n# Extract the solutions for x, y, and z\nx_val, y_val, z_val = x\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(\"Intersection point:\")\nprint(\"x =\", x_val)\nprint(\"y =\", y_val)\nprint(\"z =\", z_val)\n\n# Generate points on the planes\nx_plane1, y_plane1 = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-2, 2, 10), np.linspace(-2, 2, 10))\nz_plane1 = (1 - 3 * x_plane1 - 2 * y_plane1) / -1\n\nx_plane2, z_plane2 = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-2, 2, 10), np.linspace(-2, 2, 10))\ny_plane2 = (-2 - 2 * x_plane2 + 3 * z_plane2) / 1\n\ny_plane3, z_plane3 = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-2, 2, 10), np.linspace(-2, 2, 10))\nx_plane3 = (1 - 3 * y_plane3 - z_plane3) / 2\n\n# Create 3D plot\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\n\n# Plot the planes\nax.plot_surface(x_plane1, y_plane1, z_plane1, alpha=0.5)\nax.plot_surface(x_plane2, y_plane2, z_plane2, alpha=0.5)\nax.plot_surface(x_plane3, y_plane3, z_plane3, alpha=0.5)\n\n# Plot the intersection point\nax.scatter(x_val, y_val, z_val, color='red', label='Intersection Point')\n\n# Set labels and title\nax.set_xlabel('x')\nax.set_ylabel('y')\nax.set_zlabel('z')\nax.set_title('Intersection of Three Planes')\n\n# Show legend\nax.legend()\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nIntersection point:\nx = -0.42857142857142855\ny = 1.1428571428571428\nz = -8.881784197001253e-17\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](06.system_of_lineqr_equations_files/figure-html/cell-3-output-2.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#4f3e3d4d .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Define the vectors\nv1 = np.array([-3, 2, 1])\nv2 = np.array([-2, -1, 3])\nv3 = np.array([1, 3, 1])\n\n# Define the right-hand side vector\nrhs = np.array([1, -2, 3])\n\n# Create 3D plot\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\n\n# Plot the vectors\nax.quiver(0, 0, 0, v1[0], v1[1], v1[2], color='red', label='v1')\nax.quiver(0, 0, 0, v2[0], v2[1], v2[2], color='green', label='v2')\nax.quiver(0, 0, 0, v3[0], v3[1], v3[2], color='blue', label='v3')\n\n# Plot the right-hand side vector\nax.quiver(0, 0, 0, rhs[0], rhs[1], rhs[2], color='black', label='b')\n\n# Set equal axes scales\nax.set_xlim([-3, 3])\nax.set_ylim([-3, 3])\nax.set_zlim([-3, 3])\n\n# Set labels and title\nax.set_xlabel('x')\nax.set_ylabel('y')\nax.set_zlabel('z')\nax.set_title('Vectors in 3D Space')\n\n# Show legend\nax.legend()\n\n# Set viewing angle\nax.view_init(elev=30, azim=120)\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](06.system_of_lineqr_equations_files/figure-html/cell-4-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Elimination\n\nThe elimination method, also known as Gaussian elimination, is a systematic way to solve systems of linear equations by transforming the augmented matrix of the system into row-echelon form or reduced row-echelon form using a sequence of elementary row operations. The principle of the Gauss-Jordan elimination method is a matrix representation of the process of solving simultaneous linear equations by subtraction and substitution.\n\n::: {#def-elimination}\n\nThe elimination method (Gaussian elimination) is a systematic way to solve a system of linear equations by performing a sequence of elementary row operations on the augmented matrix of the system, with the goal of transforming the augmented matrix into row-echelon form or reduced row-echelon form.\n:::\n\n::: {#def-augmentedMatrix}\nAn augmented matrix is a matrix formed by appending the column vector $\\mathbf{b}$ to the right of matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ in the system of linear equations $\\mathbf{Ax}=\\mathbf{b}$. More formally, the augmented matrix is defined as:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na_{11} & a_{12} & \\cdots & a_{1n} & b_1 \\\\\na_{21} & a_{22} & \\cdots & a_{2n} & b_2 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\na_{m1} & a_{m2} & \\cdots & a_{mn} & b_m \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{A}$ is an $m\\times n$ matrix, $\\mathbf{b}$ is an $m\\times 1$ column vector, and the augmented matrix is an $m\\times (n+1)$ matrix.\n:::\n\n### Example\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nx_1 + 2x_2 - 3x_3 &= 4 \\\\\n2x_1 - x_2 + 4x_3 &= 7 \\\\\nx_1 + 3x_2 + 2x_3 &= 5\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe corresponding augmented matrix is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & -3 & 4 \\\\\n2 & -1 & 4 & 7 \\\\\n1 & 3 & 2 & 5\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThen the augmented matrix $[\\mathbf{A}|\\mathbf{b}]$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n[\\mathbf{A}|\\mathbf{b}] = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 2 & 3 & 4 \\end{array}\\right].\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSolving the system of linear equations $\\mathbf{Ax=b}$ is equivalent to finding the row echelon form (REF) or reduced row echelon form (RREF) of the augmented matrix $[\\mathbf{A}|\\mathbf{b}]$.\n\n::: {#def-row_operations}\n\nElementary row operations are specific operations that can be performed on the rows of a matrix to transform it into a different matrix with the same row space. There are three types of elementary row operations:\n\n1. Row scaling: Multiply a row of the matrix by a nonzero scalar.\n1. Row addition: Add a multiple of one row to another row.\n1. Row interchange: Swap the positions of two rows.\n:::\n\nElementary row operations are specific operations that can be performed on the rows of a matrix to transform it into a different matrix with the same row space. \n\n\n::: {#def-row_echelon_form}\nA matrix is said to be in row-echelon form if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. All zero rows are at the bottom of the matrix.\n1. The leading coefficient (the first non-zero entry) in each row is 1.\n1. All other entries in the same column as a leading coefficient are zero.\n1. The leading coefficient of a row occurs to the right of the leading coefficient of the row above it.\n:::\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n[\\mathbf{A}|\\mathbf{b}]=\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n3 & 0 & 5 & -3 \\\\\n0 & -9 & 3 & 5 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -1 & -4\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n::: {#def-row_reduced_echelon_form}\nA matrix is said to be in the row-reduced echelon form (or RREF) if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. All rows that contain a nonzero element are above any rows that contain only zeros (i.e., rows of all zeros, if any, are at the bottom of the matrix).\n1. The leading coefficient (the first nonzero entry) in each nonzero row is 1.\n1. The leading coefficient of any nonzero row is strictly to the right of the leading coefficient of the row above it.\n1. All other entries in the same column as a leading coefficient are zero.\n:::\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n[\\mathbf{A}|\\mathbf{b}] =\n\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n3 & 0 & 5 & -3 \\\\\n0 & -9 & 3 & 5 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -1 & -4\n\\end{array}\\right]_{\\text{row echolon form}} \\rightarrow\n[\\mathbf{A}|\\mathbf{b}] =\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 0 & 0 & -\\frac{47}{27} \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & \\frac{23}{27} \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 4\n\\end{array}\\right]_{\\text{row reduced echolon form}}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n\n\nThe row-echelon form (or row-reduced echelon form or RREF) is a systematic way of representing a matrix such that it has certain properties, making it easier to solve linear equations using methods like Gaussian elimination. In row-echelon form, the leading coefficient (the first non-zero entry) in each row is 1, and all other entries in the same column are zero.\n\nFrom the row-echolon form, it produces an **upper triangular system** and the reduced one or RREF is **the final goal to solve the system**.\n\n### Example\n\n#### Unique Solution\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& 2x + y - z = 3 \\\\\n& 3x - 2y + 2z = 1 \\\\\n& x + 3y - z = 4 \\\\\n\n& \\text{the augmented matrix:} \\\\\n& \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 1 & -1 & | & 3 \\\\\n3 & -2 & 2 & | & 1 \\\\\n1 & 3 & -1 & | & 4 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n\\\\\n& \\text{Perform elementary row operations:} \\\\\n\\\\\n& \\text{Row2 = Row2 - 3/2 * Row1} \\\\\n& \\text{Row3 = Row3 - 1/2 * Row1} \\\\\n\\\\\n& \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 1 & -1 &| & 3 \\\\\n0 & -5/2 & 7/2&| & -7/2 \\\\\n0 & 5/2 & -1/2&| & 5/2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n\\\\\n& \\text{Row3 = Row3 + Row2} \\\\\n\\\\\n& \\text{Row Echelon Form:} \\\\\n& \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 1 & -1 &| & 3 \\\\\n0 & -5/2 & 7/2 &| & -7/2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 3 &| & -1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n\\\\\n& \\text{Reduced Row Echelon Form:} \\\\\n&\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 &| & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 &|& 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 &|& -\\frac{1}{3} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\\\\n\\\\\n& \\text{Breakdown: Perform back substitution to obtain the solution:} \\\\\n& z = -1/3 \\\\\n& y = -2/3 \\\\\n& x = 4/3\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n#### Infinitely Many Solutions\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& 3x + 2y - z = 4 \\\\\n& 6x + 4y - 2z = 8 \\\\\n& 9x + 6y - 3z = 12 \\\\\n& \\text{the augmented matrix:} \\\\\n& \\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 2 & -1 & | & 4 \\\\\n6 & 4 & -2 & | & 8 \\\\\n9 & 6 & -3 & | & 12 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n\n& \\text{Perform elementary row operations:} \\\\\n\\\\\n& \\text{Row2 = Row2 - 2 * Row1} \\\\\n& \\text{Row3 = Row3 - 3 * Row1} \\\\\n\\\\\n& \\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 2 & -1 &| & 4 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 &| & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 &| & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n\\\\\n& \\text{Row Echelon Form:} \\\\\n& \\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 2 & -1 &| & 4 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 &| & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 &| & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n\\\\\n& \\text{Reduced Row Echelon Form:} \\\\\n& \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & \\frac{2}{3} & -\\frac{1}{3} &| & \\frac{4}{3} \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 &| & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 &| & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n\\\\\n& \\text{Breakdown:} \\\\\n& \\text{Perform back substitution to obtain the solution:} \\\\\n& z = t \\quad \\text{(where t is a parameter)} \\\\\n& y = s \\quad \\text{(where s is a parameter)} \\\\\n& x = \\frac{4}{3} - \\frac{2}{3}y + \\frac{1}{3}z \\quad \\text{(in terms of t and s)}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIn this example, the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions because after performing row operations, the rows become all zeros in the second and third rows, indicating that there are infinitely many values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy the system of equations. The parameters t and s can take any real values, and the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ can be expressed in terms of $t$ and $s$.\n\nHaving zero rows in a Reduced Row Echelon Form of a system of linear equations indicates that these equations are redundant or equivalent to the other equations in the system. It means that the information provided by these equations does not add any new constraints or information to the system.\n\n#### No Solution\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& 2x + 3y - z = 7 \\\\\n& 4x + 6y - 2z = 12 \\\\\n& 3x + 4y - z = 8 \\\\\n\n& \\text{the augmented matrix:} \\\\\n& \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 & -1 & | & 7 \\\\\n4 & 6 & -2 & | & 12 \\\\\n3 & 4 & -1 & | & 8 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n\n& \\text{Perform elementary row operations:} \\\\\n\\\\\n& \\text{Row2 = Row2 - 2 * Row1} \\\\\n& \\text{Row3 = Row3 - 3/2 * Row1} \\\\\n\\\\\n& \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 & -1 &| & 7 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0&| & -2 \\\\\n0 & 1/2 & 1/2&| & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n\\\\\n& \\text{Row3 = Row3 - 1/2 * Row2} \\\\\n\\\\\n& \\text{Row Echelon Form:} \\\\\n& \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 & -1 &| & 7 \\\\\n0 & 1/2 & 1/2 &| & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 &| & -2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n\\\\\n& \\text{Reduced Row Echelon Form:} \\\\\n&\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3/2 & -1/2 &| & 7/2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 &|& 2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 &|& -2 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe last row of the reduced row echelon form has all zeros except for the right-hand side (RHS) part, which is $-2$. This implies that $0 = -2$, which is not possible. Therefore, there is no solution to this system of linear equations.\n\nLike the above, the augmented matrix of an already solved system of linear equations is always a reduced-row echelon form.\n왜냐면, 가우스 조던 소거법은 연립방정식을 가감법과 대입법을 matrix 형태로 표현한 것이기 때문이다. 이 가우스 조던 소거법에서 수행한 일련의 기본 행 연산들을 operation matrix 형태로 표현 할 수 있고 이를 원 matrix와 행렬 곱 형태로도 표시할 수 있다.\n* 가감법: leading entry를 1로 맞춰 주는 과정 (가우스 소거법)\n* 대입법: 1로 구성된 leading entry들을 제외한 모든 entry를 0으로 만들어주는 과정 (가우스 조던 소거법)\n\n",
